Sentry's App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch.

<Note>

The App Start Instrumentation is shipped with Sentry's Flutter SDK automatically.

</Note>

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how the App Start Instrumentation behaves:

- The SDK attaches the app start metrics to the **first run transaction**.
- It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the very first [PostFrameCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addPostFrameCallback.html) is triggered.
- The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure:

1. Sentry Flutter SDK must be initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure)
2. Performance Monitoring must be set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/performance/).

## Configure

The instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Verify

Execute a transaction directly

## Additional Configuration

- If you don't initialize the SDK early in the app's lifecycle, you can also customize the ending of the app start by disabling the `autoAppStart` flag and calling the `SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd` function.
