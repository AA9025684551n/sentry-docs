Sentry supports data storage in both the US and the EU. 

You can choose where to store your data when you’re setting up your Sentry account by selecting from the dropdown menu under "Data Storage" in the "Create a New Organization" section. 

Your selection determines your data storage location only. Sentry will continue to access and process your data in accordance with your agreement with Sentry for the Sentry service and our [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

<Note>
Once selected, your data storage location can’t be changed. The only way to switch regions is by creating a new account. 
</Note>

The table below shows the location of the data center where your data will be stored at rest, based on your selection.

| **Data Center** | **Location** |
| United States of America (USA) | Iowa, USA |
| European Union (EU) | Frankfurt, Germany |

## What Types of Data Are Stored Where

Here’s a list of the types of data that will be stored in whichever local region (US or EU) that you select.

### Data Stored In Selected Region (US or EU)

- Error events, activity, and issue links
- Transactions
- Profiles
- Cron check-ins
- Project metadata
- DSN keys
- Organization settings, configuration, and teams
- Release health
- Releases, Debug Symbols, and source maps
- Detailed Usage Data
- Session Replays
- Backups for these resources

### Data Stored in US

- User accounts, notification settings, and 2FA authenticators. (User accounts are shared by many organizations.)
- Organization integration metadata.
  (Integrations can be shared across organizations and many of our integrations only support sending their webhooks to a singular destination.)
- Access tokens for users and organizations
- Sentry applications
- SSO, SAML, and SCIM endpoints
- Organization audit logs

Metadata that lets Sentry identify an organization or a user's region will be replicated out of the organization's region to facilitate login, and backwards-compatible APIs. You can always confirm the location of your organization by viewing your organization's settings page.
