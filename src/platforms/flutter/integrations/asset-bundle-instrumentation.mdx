The [AssetBundle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html) instrumentation provides insight into how long your app takes to load its assets, such as files.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

- The instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each `load` and `loadString` call. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `file.read`.
- The instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each `loadStructuredData` call. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `serialize`.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure:

1. Sentry Flutter SDK must be initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Performance Monitoring must be set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/performance/).

## Configure

Wrap the `runApp` method with a `DefaultAssetBundle` and `SentryAssetBundle`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
      appRunner: () => runApp(
        DefaultAssetBundle(
          bundle: SentryAssetBundle(),
          child: MyApp(),
        ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling the `loadStructuredData` feature

The `loadStructuredData` is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

SentryAssetBundle(enableStructuredDataTracing: false)
```
